Task 1:
graph's field EdgeList is already using pointers, but VertexList is not. This can lead to problems if we call AddEdge out of the class
because the vertices in VertexList would be copies of the "real" vertices.
If we just set VertexList to pointers, this can be equally awfull if we call AddEdge from inside the class, which we do not do yet but
will probably do (see next task to do), but I think that this may be the good way.

Task 2:
Create a constructor for graph class that reads a .txt (as "com-youtube.top5000.cmty.txt") and creates both VertexList and EdgeList. 
Check the comments of task one about the elements of VertexList being pointers or vertex objects
